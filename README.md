##  HR Dashboard – Employee Insights

This Power BI dashboard gives a clear, interactive snapshot of an organization’s workforce at a glance. It’s designed to help HR teams quickly understand employee distribution, potential promotion or retrenchment needs, experience levels, and other key workforce metrics without digging through spreadsheets.

From the **Home** view you can see total headcount, gender split, years of service, job levels, how many employees are active versus due for promotion/retrenchment, and how close employees live to the office.

The **Action** page lists the specific employees flagged for attention — those who are due for promotion or might be reaching retrenchment status — so HR can plan conversations or decisions.

The **Detail** view breaks this down further by department and role, showing how promotions and retrenchments are distributed and comparing satisfaction or retention indicators across groups.

Everything updates interactively, so selecting any section or filter instantly reflects across the visuals.
